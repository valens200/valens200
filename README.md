I’m **Valens Niyonsenga**, a full-stack backend-heavy software developer with 3 years of experience. I’m an active contributor at [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) working on [REST API Improvements](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/0oTx6AYV) with [FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/) by Siemens, India under the Linux foundation projects.  I have already built 3 startups, and 4 successful projects for clients and gained great ratings in competitive programming at Leetcode and CodeChef. Most essential for every Software project, my extensive experience in leading and architecting large software development projects makes me an ideal candidate for your project.
