# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="40px">

I am **Valens NIYONSENGA**,  a Google Summer of Code 2024 contributor at FOSSology.  I am passionate about solving challenges in the community using Software Engineering and bringing about innovative projects in my society. I have 4 years of experience working with programming languages such as  PHP, Java, Python, C/C++, Node.js, and Django on the backend side. Iâ€™m also very familiar with front-end technologies such as ReactJS and Vue. 

I spend most of my time-solving competitive programming problems at Leetcode and Codechef, which helps me enhance my problem-solving skills
